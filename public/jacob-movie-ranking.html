<h2>My top movies that I watched in 2026</h2>
<hr />
<h3> Air (2023) </h3>
<p> This was a fascinating tail of the creation of the Air Jordan shoes.</p>
<h3>28 Years Later: The Bone Temple</h3>
<p> I saw this in theaters, a little bloody at times but Ralph Fiennes was great.</p>
<h3> Sinners (2025).</h3>
<p>I loved the vibe in this movie, the acting was fantastic.</p>
